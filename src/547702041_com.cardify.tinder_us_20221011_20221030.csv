Some people want something long term and others just want a hookup. There‚Äôs clearly no filters/preferences to ensure that more people sign up and take longer to find someone. What would help this is if tinder actually cared to make the effort to include more than just the generic gender & orientation filters. *UPDATE* The 5-6 interest feature is a pathetic excuse for a fix to the lack of filters. If OKC can figure it out so can you, tinder. Speaking of OKC, tinder also really needs to nip the catfishing in the bud by mandating every tinder user to do the face verification test(and maybe every time we open the app ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è clearly we can‚Äôt be trusted). They‚Äôre purposely not adding these features because not enough of us are complaining about it and they‚Äôre making money off not adding them. Otherwise if you‚Äôre already lucky and conventionally attractive to most in real life then you might still do decent on tinder. Still a ripoff, though. *UPDATE* The Spotify feature is extremely out of date with what you‚Äôre listening to by several months and/or randomly selects artists you might listen to on a minimal level so it does nothing to actually portray your actual music taste. If you select to remove particular artists it never updates and will include those artists until you disconnect Spotify altogether. *UPDATE* The ‚Äúverification‚Äù process is apparently being hacked by extra tech-savvy catfish now‚Ä¶.or the facial recognition feature is just for show, cause even verified profiles are still using photos that are clearly not there‚Äôs.

The APPS prices have significantly went up for the Premium services than what they used to be and a bit more ridiculously priced from other Apps. Like now you can‚Äôt see who‚Äôs swiped on yoou unless you have the gold service when it used to be on the plus service which plus practically serves no purpose and even now with having the gold service even though I can see who swipes on me it‚Äôs as if I don‚Äôt get any swipes because the app keeps promoting for you to buy boosts and I used the one free boost and got tons of swipes!!! But now not using boost and not wanting to pay for boost I get like 15 swipes a day and I‚Äôve only had gold membership for a week now and I do swipe on other people as well and can see who is still in the que for who I have swiped on and it seems as though tinder isn‚Äôt showing me in their swipe stacks because I would of guessed those people to of swiped Yes or No on me by now. The experience on here in general has been worst than it has in the past. As far as Dating Apps go Tinder has significantly went down and I would say try else where unless you want to spend a lot of money for no results and am already regretting my decision and it has been a huge waste of money.

Tinder. 
I, myself, have been banned from Tinder and still don‚Äôt understand why. However, once you‚Äôre banned, you‚Äôre banned forever. No appeal allowed and they won‚Äôt give any reason otherwise. 
I discourage individuals from downloading this app, and believe you will potentially waste your own time and just end up getting banned like the rest of us. 
There‚Äôs no reason or explanation why this is happening so often to users, but all I can say is that it‚Äôs obvious that the developers don‚Äôt necessarily care to handle it. 
Go outside, talk amongst friends, network, etc.

They are plagued with bots, scams, and girls who are only there to try and get money yet ban real people at an alarming rate for no reason given. As a male i feel discriminated against and will be pursuing litigation.

 There is absolutely no reason for me to be banned. I hadn‚Äôt used the app in years,  I paid for unlimited swipes. Used it for a day then banned. No reason given and I wasn‚Äôt being rude at all. Now they won‚Äôt refund me the money they stole. 

It seems like the beta males in charge of this app are doing are doing everything they can to prevent men from actually using it. You‚Äôd think they would be smart enough to focus on getting rid of all the spam and bots before they banned paying customers for absolutely no reason. You see people selling drugs on the app ALL the time, yet the people being banned are just good guys looking for a date. 

Ive heard about this happening to a ton of people. You give them $20 for a service then the next day those ppl are banned. I guess it is there plan so those people are forced to make new accounts and spend more money. 

The people in charge of this app should be ashamed of how they treat their customers and deal with bans. And just because someone reports someone doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that person did something. The other person could be mad just because they didn‚Äôt get a response.

It is obvious that it‚Äôs primary function is to get users to pay for their subscription services. If you don‚Äôt then you will never match with anyone. Before buying the subscription service it will store and hide the pictures/bios from you of all the users that swiped right on you already to match. But it will tease you by showing you the number amount of people‚Äôs profiles that it‚Äôs gate keeping from you LOL. I reached over 100 before I paid for the subscription just out of curiosity (I only liked back one or two profiles) and once they got my money I never got anymore potential matches!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=547702041&type=Purple%20Software

It's not hard to distinguish these profiles as most of them have blatantly fake snap or insta usernames on their bio, Tinder is obviously making no effort to combat this. 
It would be nice if they implemented a reward system for reporting fake profiles, or at least a notification that shows accounts that you've reported were taken down?  Without this, you are left with absolutely no reason or incentive to report these numerous fake accounts.

Sometimes the resolution was simply a technical matter such as Tinder‚Äôs spam filters inadvertently flagging profiles automatically. Therefore, I‚Äôve now decided that I will pursue this avenue as well. Tinder cannot continue to treat their paying customers like this.

But out of nowhere, I tried to login and found out my account was banned. And when this happens, there‚Äôs no appeal process and they don‚Äôt give you ANY reason as to why it happened. The reason why I‚Äôm guessing I got banned was because I accidentally glitched out of the photo verification process and they just shut my account down. It seems I‚Äôm not the only one, too. 

Their support is also atrocious. Good luck actually talking to a human being. I tried submitting a request on their website, and got an automated response basically saying tough luck. They put a phone number on their website, but the line goes dead when you try to call. You can go on their support site on Twitter and you‚Äôll see just how terrible they are. They honestly don‚Äôt care about you, even if you pay them $89 + a year for their useless premium subscriptions.  

What‚Äôs also troubling is that people who ACTUALLY DESERVE to be banned are running rampant on that app! There‚Äôs bots, people being sexually harassed (pictures of that on twitter, and they had a generic ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù response to it), and constant spam accounts. Even worse, I saw that trans people are being banned also for no reason! Additionally, if they ban you here, they‚Äôre highly likely to do the same on other apps their parent corporation is affiliated with (OkCupid, Hinge). 

In short, just try other apps. Once they ban you, you can never use it again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=547702041&type=Purple%20Software

It started back in 2021 because before then I was matching with almost everyone I swiped right on and getting a bunch of messages on it. Then sometime in 2021 all I kept seeing were ugly people and getting very few right swipes. Even on my trip out to San Diego I saw nothing but uggos which is odd because in the past some of my hottest matches have been from out that way. So my account had to have been shadow banned for a while. Anyways I woke up this morning and out of no where I was banned? I emailed them and got an automated response saying I violated their community rules. Read the page up and down and don‚Äôt know what I could‚Äôve possibly done to have been banned?? I don‚Äôt promote anything on tinder, all my pictures are clothed, I‚Äôve been respectful on it.

Tinder from 2016-2019 was unbelievable. Thank you, Tinder, for the great times. I wish this app never fell off, but I understand. So many subconscious standards from social media/Hollywood have made it almost impossible to find a mere date on Tinder. 

It‚Äôs not rocket science. It‚Äôs pretty simple why this phenomenon is occurring. First of all we are in the most feminist time in history. And I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs a bad thing. It just so happens to be that a good thing indirectly is affecting a large portion of young males disproportionately. I am not here to blame feminism on the decline of my romantic career, but rather simply stating that there is a noticeable increase in the standards to date a girl that you find attractive to even begin with. 

I get it, you want to have the Bearded 29-32 year old with a truck, property, and a high paying job. Or you want the surfer fem boy from UCLA, who has a sleek chiseled face like Channing Tatum. I get it. More power to you right? Overall, yeah I‚Äôm a little butt hurt that girls have raised their standards so high that most don‚Äôt even need dating apps cause their DMs are already filled to brim.

Unless you‚Äôre a total hunk/man candy, trust me when I say you‚Äôre wasting your time. Tinder profits from the misery of men who are either looking for something casual or a meaningful relationship. Even as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù guy, you won‚Äôt find anything with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù girl. It‚Äôs just not designed that way. 

Over the years, I‚Äôve probably had around 100 matches. Of those matches, minus people I know IRL and scammers, I have had exactly zero conversations. 

I‚Äôve gone through a million cycles of deleting and redownloading Tinder. Paid for boosts, tried tinder gold a few times, and the result is always the same. No real connection for either a relationship or a hookup or even a friend. Just scammers, girls who want attention/validation from guys they won‚Äôt pursue, and possibly people that you already knew. Let this be your wake up call. 

If you‚Äôre a normal guy, Tinder does not work. Try hinge if you‚Äôre that afraid of talking to be people in the real world; I‚Äôve heard some good things about it.

You can actually swipe through, and you might run into the ones who liked you. One of them disappeared, while the other, stayed, even after swiping left. I think the code written is meant to get people to buy their subscription so you can see the like. I‚Äôm also not sure if that‚Äôs a bug, however, coming from a software developer standpoint, that‚Äôs a bad QA team for not fixing this bug. One more observation, is that once you paid your subscription, which I tried, another thing happens is you become invisible. Either you have purchase your boost to get exposure, or possibly your likes never got sent through. And oddly enough, this doesn‚Äôt happen for the female side of the app. It‚Äôs honestly a big money grabbing app. Also, the app will randomly unmatch your matches, and sometimes they‚Äôll reappear.

I‚Äôve been using the app on and off for about a year when I‚Äôve been in and out of relationships, and I really enjoyed my experience. I met loads of awesome people on the app and while very few ever turned into anything in person, it was a nice distraction. A couple days ago, I opened the app to discover I was banned. Now, this came as a surprise to me, because I had done nothing wrong to be banned from the app. No explanation was provided in the app, and when I reached out to support, no explanation was provided because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt provide explanations for why bans are issued and don‚Äôt offer appeals.‚Äù Yikes. This feels very targeted and personally I am very disappointed and disgusted with the way Tinder handles their banning process. At the very least - I deserve to know what rule I supposedly violated that led me to be banned from the app. To provide no explanation at all is just another example of Tinder having absolutely no regard for the safety of its users or caring about its users at all. Sincerely, and I mean GENUINELY disappointed in Tinder. Tinder - do better. You are taking advantage of your users and people are noticing.
